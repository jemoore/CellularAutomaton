# CellularAutomaton
Note: This is by no means a great implementation.  This was as much a way of experimenting with CMake (and including google test) as implementing Conway's game of life.

This is an implementation of a cellular automaton, specifically Conway's game of life.
However, expandability was something I had in mind so it should be fairly easy to add
other cellular automation (Langton's ant, von Neumann, etc...)
